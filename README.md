# YOUR PROJECT TITLE

#### Description:
I created a basic sight word for kids to learn new sight words which are really essential for reading using JS, HTML and CSS. This app includes bunch of other features like register/user login backed with Firebase as a backend. Once user login and registered they can have an access to the main page, where they can use the app with two options, sight words / reading and memory game. 

##

## Motivation
The idea behind this app is to learn authentication and security models for frontend websites. On registration, this application asks users to register and log in. If the user details don't match or the user is already registered, The app will show the alert.

The application was built as a part of a learning activity of my udemy course from Brad Travesy. I learned a great deal of things on how to use Firebase as a backend, but later, i will format this app using a proper backend technology with database.
